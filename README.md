## Overview

This project is an e-commerce website developed using Python Flask for the backend, Bootstrap templates for the frontend, and SQLAlchemy for database management.

## Features

- Frontend-Backend Integration: Successful linking of the frontend to the backend.
- Responsive Design: Utilized Bootstrap templates for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Challenges

- Login Page: Currently, a login page is not implemented. This is a work in progress.

2. Install dependencies:

    ```

3. Run the Flask application:

4. Access the application in your browser: After running the main.py click on http://127.0.0.1:5000
